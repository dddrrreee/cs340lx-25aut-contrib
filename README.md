## 340lx-25 repository for external contributions

For 340lx we try to steal as many good ideas as possible for future
classes.

One time:
  - give us your github handle in class.

Many times: To minimize conflicts, use this workflow or equiv:
  1. Do all your work in your 340lx repository.
  2. When you code works, mkdir a directory with your name in the associated
     lab in cs340lx-25aut-contrib.
  3. Copy your code there, make sure it still works.  
  4. Make clean so you don't get in extraneous files.
  5. Make sure your name is in your code so you get credit from anyone
     that uses it.
  6. Ideally: add a short (or long) README.md.
  7. Commit and push!
